# bubble-sort

 First Ruby project fron the Microverse curriculum.
 In this project, we were asked to build a bubble sorting algorithm where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.
